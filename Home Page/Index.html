            <h2>About Air Pollution</h2>
            <p> ⭐ Air pollution is contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment by any chemical, physical or biological agent that modifies the natural characteristics of the atmosphere.<br>
                ⭐ Household combustion devices, motor vehicles, industrial facilities and forest fires are common sources of air pollution. <br>⭐Pollutants of major public health concern include particulate matter, carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide.<br> Outdoor and indoor air pollution cause respiratory and other diseases and are important sources of morbidity and mortality. 
                <br>⭐ WHO(World Health organization) data show that almost all of the global population (99%) breathe air that exceeds WHO guideline limits and contains high levels of pollutants, with low- and middle-income countries suffering from the highest exposures.
                <br>⭐ Air quality is closely linked to the earth’s climate and ecosystems globally. Many of the drivers of air pollution (i.e. combustion of fossil fuels) are also sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Policies to reduce air pollution, therefore, offer a win-win strategy for both climate and health, lowering the burden of disease attributable to air pollution, as well as contributing to the near- and long-term mitigation of climate change.

            <h2>Types of Air Pollutants</h2>
            <p>There are two types of air pollutants:<br><br>
                ⭐ <span>Primary Pollutants:</span> <br>
                   The pollutants that directly cause air pollution are known as primary pollutants. Sulphur-dioxide emitted from factories is a primary pollutant.<br><br>
                ⭐ <span>Secondary Pollutants:</span><br>
                   The pollutants formed by the intermingling and reaction of primary pollutants are known as secondary pollutants. Smog, formed by the intermingling of smoke and fog, is a secondary pollutant.<br>

                </section>
        <section id="causes">
                <h2>Causes of Air Pollution</h2><p>
                Following are the important causes of air pollution:<br><br>
                ⭐<span>Burning of Fossil Fuels:</span>
                 The combustion of fossil fuels emits a large amount of sulphur dioxide. Carbon monoxide released by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels also results in air pollution.
                
                <br><br>⭐ <span>Automobiles:</span><br>
                The gases emitted from vehicles such as jeeps, trucks, cars, buses, etc. pollute the environment. These are the major sources of greenhouse gases and also result in diseases among individuals.
                
                <br><br>⭐ <span>Agricultural Activities:</span><br>
                Ammonia is one of the most hazardous gases emitted during agricultural activities. The insecticides, pesticides and fertilisers emit harmful chemicals in the atmosphere and contaminate it.
                
                ><br><br>⭐ <span>Factories and Industries:</span><br>
                Factories and industries are the main source of carbon monoxide, organic compounds, hydrocarbons and chemicals. These are released into the air, degrading its quality.
                
                <br><br>⭐ <span>Mining Activities:</span><br>
                In the mining process, the minerals below the earth are extracted using large pieces of equipment. The dust and chemicals released during the process not only pollute the air, but also deteriorate the health of the workers and people living in the nearby areas.
                
                <br><br>⭐ <span>Domestic Sources:</span><br>
                The household cleaning products and paints contain toxic chemicals that are released in the air. The smell from the newly painted walls is the smell of the chemicals present in the paints. It not only pollutes the air but also affects breathing.</p>

            <h2>Effects of Air Pollution</h2>
            <p>Health & Environmental Effects of Air Pollution
                Health Effects
                Air pollution can harm us when it accumulates in the air in high enough concentrations.
                Millions of Americans live in areas where urban smog, particle pollution, and toxic
                pollutants pose serious health concerns.
                The hazardous effects of air pollution on the environment include:

                <br>⭐ <span>Diseases:</span>
                Air pollution has resulted in several respiratory disorders and heart diseases among humans. The cases of lung cancer have increased in the last few decades. Children living near polluted areas are more prone to pneumonia and asthma. Many people die every year due to the direct or indirect effects of air pollution.

                <br><br>⭐ <span>Global Warming:</span>
                Due to the emission of greenhouse gases, there is an imbalance in the gaseous composition of the air. This has led to an increase in the temperature of the earth. This increase in earth’s temperature is known as global warming. This has resulted in the melting of glaciers and an increase in sea levels. Many areas are submerged underwater.

                <br><br>⭐ <span>Acid Rain:</span>
                The burning of fossil fuels releases harmful gases such as nitrogen oxides and sulphur oxides in the air. The water droplets combine with these pollutants, become acidic and fall as acid rain which damages human, animal and plant life.

                <br><br>⭐ <span>Ozone Layer Depletion:</span>
                The release of chlorofluorocarbons, halons, and hydrochlorofluorocarbons in the atmosphere is the major cause of depletion of the ozone layer. The depleting ozone layer does not prevent the harmful ultraviolet rays coming from the sun and causes skin diseases and eye problems among individuals.

                <br><br>⭐ <span>Effect on Animals:</span>
                The air pollutants suspend in the water bodies and affect aquatic life. Pollution also compels the animals to leave their habitat and shift to a new place. This renders them stray and has also led to the extinction of a large number of animal species.
                <br><br> People exposed to high enough levels of
                certain air pollutants may experience:<br>
                <br>⭐ Irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat.
                <br>⭐ Wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and breathing difficulties.
                <br>⭐ Worsening of existing lung and heart problems, such as asthma.
                <br>⭐ Increased risk of heart attack.
                <br><br>In addition, long-term exposure to air pollution can cause cancer and damage to the
                immune, neurological, reproductive, and respiratory systems. In extreme cases, it can
                even cause death.
                <br><br>⭐<span>Who Is Most at Risk❓</span>
                <br>Air pollution is a problem for all of us. However, some groups of people are especially
                sensitive to common air pollutants such as particulates and ground-level ozone.
                Sensitive populations include children, older adults, people who are active outdoors,
                and people with heart or lung diseases, such as asthma. If you are sensitive to air
                pollution, you need to be aware of steps you can take to protect your health.
                For more information on sensitive populations and the health effects of common air

            <h2>Solutions for Controlling Air Pollution</h2>
            <p>Following are the measures one should adopt, to control air pollution:
                <br><br>⭐ <span>Avoid Using Vehicles:</span>
                People should avoid using vehicles for shorter distances. Rather, they should prefer public modes of transport to travel from one place to another. This not only prevents pollution, but also conserves energy.
                
                <br><br>⭐ <span>Energy Conservation:</span>
                A large number of fossil fuels are burnt to generate electricity. Therefore, do not forget to switch off the electrical appliances when not in use. Thus, you can save the environment at the individual level. Use of energy-efficient devices such as CFLs also controls pollution to a greater level.
                
                <br><br>⭐ <span>Use of Clean Energy Resources:</span>
                The use of solar, wind and geothermal energies reduce air pollution at a larger level. Various countries, including India, have implemented the use of these resources as a step towards a cleaner environment.
                
                <br><br><span>Other air pollution control measures include:</span>
                
                <br><br>1. By minimising and reducing the use of fire and fire products.
                <br><br>2. Since industrial emissions are one of the major causes of air pollution, the pollutants can be controlled or treated at the source itself to reduce its effects. For example, if the reactions of a certain raw material yield a pollutant, then the raw materials can be substituted with other less polluting materials.
                <br><br>3. Fuel substitution is another way of controlling air pollution. In many parts of India, petrol and diesel are being replaced by CNG – Compressed Natural Gas fueled vehicles. These are mostly adopted by vehicles that aren’t fully operating with ideal emission engines.
                <br><br>4. Although there are many practices in India, which focus on repairing the quality of air, most of them are either forgotten or not being enforced properly. There are still a lot of vehicles on roads which haven’t been tested for vehicle emissions.
                <br><br>5. Another way of controlling air pollution caused by industries is to modify and maintain existing pieces of equipment so that the emission of pollutants is minimised.
                <br><br>6. Sometimes controlling pollutants at the source is not possible. In that case, we can have process control equipment to control the pollution.
                <br><br>7. A very effective way of controlling air pollution is by diluting the air pollutants.
                <br><br>8. The last and the best way of reducing the ill effects of air pollution is tree plantation. Plants and trees reduce a large number of pollutants in the air. Ideally, planting trees in areas of high pollution levels will be extremely effective.</p>

            <h2>Our Scheme</h2>
            <p>Our main motive is reduce Air Pollution in Our Locality as most as Possible by Using Our Product designed to tackle indoor air pollution effectively:-
                <br><br> ⭐ <span>Air Purifiers: </span> Air purifiers are perhaps the most well-known solution for improving indoor air quality. These devices work by removing contaminants such as dust, pollen, pet dander, and even harmful gases from the air. Advanced models feature HEPA filters, activated carbon filters, and UV-C light technology to efficiently capture and neutralize pollutants. Investing in a high-quality air purifier can significantly reduce indoor air pollution and alleviate respiratory issues.
                <br><br> ⭐ <span>Indoor Plants: </span> Plants are natural air purifiers, capable of absorbing harmful pollutants and releasing oxygen through photosynthesis. Certain houseplants, such as peace lilies, spider plants, and snake plants, are particularly effective at filtering indoor air. Strategically placing these plants throughout your home can help remove toxins like formaldehyde, benzene, and trichloroethylene, thus improving air quality in a sustainable and aesthetically pleasing manner.
                <br><br> ⭐ <span>Ventilation Systems: </span>Proper ventilation is essential for maintaining good indoor air quality. Installing ventilation systems, such as exhaust fans and air exchangers, helps remove stale air and pollutants while circulating fresh air into the living space. Energy-efficient ventilation solutions not only reduce air pollution but also promote comfort and energy savings by optimizing airflow and temperature control.
            <h2>Our Major Product:-</h2>
